## ✅ F2 - Schema Design with Privacy Controls

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **PII Separation**: Behavioral data (`UserProfile`) completely separate from personal data (`UserPII`)
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent tracking for analytics, marketing, personalization
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data deletion, consent withdrawal, data portability
- **Privacy Levels**: None, Low, Medium, High classification for all data

### Data Models
```python
UserProfile:        # Behavioral data only
- user_id, preferences, goals, activity_patterns
- nutrition_focus, engagement_metrics
- No PII stored

UserPII:           # Personal data separate
- name, email, phone, location
- birth_date, health_conditions
- Consent-protected access
```

### Consent Types
- `ANALYTICS` - Event tracking and metrics
- `MARKETING` - Communication and campaigns  
- `PERSONALIZATION` - Customized experience
- `RESEARCH` - Anonymized insights

## ✅ F3 - Warehouse Processing & Dashboards

### Analytics Processing Engine
**Activation Funnel Analysis:**
- Registration → Profile Setup → First Plan → First Log → Active User
- Conversion rates at each step
- Cohort-based progression tracking

**Retention & Cohort Metrics:**
- Day 1, 7, 30, 90 retention rates
- Monthly cohort analysis
- Churn prediction and prevention

**Revenue Analytics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Conversion rates by traffic source
- Revenue per user trends

### Dashboard APIs (12 Endpoints)

1. **`/dashboard`** - Executive summary with key metrics
2. **`/funnel`** - Activation funnel analysis
3. **`/cohorts`** - User cohort retention analysis
4. **`/revenue`** - Revenue metrics and projections
5. **`/adherence`** - Meal plan adherence tracking
6. **`/events/summary`** - Event volume and patterns
7. **`/user-journey`** - Individual user path analysis
8. **`/engagement`** - Feature usage and engagement
9. **`/notifications`** - Notification effectiveness
10. **`/conversions`** - Subscription conversion tracking
11. **`/churn-risk`** - At-risk user identification
12. **`/consent`** - Privacy consent management

### Real-Time Capabilities
- Event processing with 5-minute batch intervals
- Cache-optimized dashboard data (5-minute TTL)
- Background processing for heavy analytics
- Async event tracking (no user impact)
