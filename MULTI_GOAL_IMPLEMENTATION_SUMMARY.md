## üéØ Key Features Delivered

### ‚úÖ 1. Blend Multiple Goals
- **Natural Input**: "I want to eat on a budget, build muscle, and improve gut health"
- **Conversational Acknowledgment**: "Got it ‚Äî you want to build muscle *without breaking the bank*"
- **Constraint Translation**: 
  - Nutrition targets (protein: 140g, fiber: 35g, calories: 2200)
  - Budget cap ($4.00/meal max)
  - Food emphasis (cheap high-protein staples, fermented foods)
- **Hybrid Plans**: Chicken thighs + beans + sauerkraut combos
- **Graceful Trade-offs**: "Budget may limit premium salmon, but I'll maximize affordable protein sources"

### ‚úÖ 2. Handle Unknown/Custom Goals
- **Never Reject**: Always acknowledge unusual goals
- **Intelligent Clarification**: "I don't have a dedicated *skin health* tracker, but I can include foods rich in omega-3s & antioxidants"
- **Custom Goal Storage**: `{"type": "custom", "label": "skin health", "constraints": {...}}`
- **Dietary Proxies**:
  - Skin health ‚Üí omega-3, antioxidants, zinc
  - Sleep ‚Üí magnesium, tryptophan, avoid evening caffeine
  - Brain health ‚Üí omega-3 fish, blueberries, dark leafy greens
- **Knowledge Base**: Track popular custom goals for promotion to standard features

### ‚úÖ 3. Technical Implementation
- **Array Support**: `UserProfile.goals` supports multiple goal objects
- **Priority System**: 1-4 priority levels with weighted constraint merging
- **AI Prompt Builder**: Dynamic context generation with goal priorities
- **Goal Prioritization**: "budget is more important than variety" ‚Üí constraint weighting

### ‚úÖ 4. Profitability Hooks
- **Premium Upsell**: "Want me to optimize across all three goals? Unlock with Premium."
- **Niche Expansion**: Popular custom goals become new paid features
- **Community Growth**: "Others also asked for sleep-friendly plans. Should we expand?"
- **Analytics Integration**: Track trending custom goals for product development

## üó®Ô∏è Example Conversations Supported

### Multi-Goal Declaration
```
User: "I want to eat on a budget, build muscle, and improve gut health"
Bot: "Got it üëç budget-friendly + muscle gain + gut health. I'll focus on affordable, high-protein meals (chicken thighs, beans, lentils), include fermented foods and fiber for gut health, and keep everything within your budget cap. Since you mentioned three goals, do you want me to prioritize budget, muscle, or gut health most strongly?"
```

### Goal Prioritization
```
User: "budget is more important than muscle gain"
Bot: "Got it! I'll prioritize budget-friendly in your meal plans. üéØ Want me to update your meal plan with these new priorities? üîÑ"
```

### Custom Goal Handling
```
User: "skin health"
Bot: "I don't have a dedicated *skin health* tracker, but I can focus on omega-3s, antioxidants, and skin-supporting nutrients. I'll learn what works for you as we go and adapt your meal suggestions! Want me to create a meal plan that includes this goal? ü•ó"
```

### Monetization Integration
```
User: "I have budget, muscle gain, gut health, and energy goals"
Bot: "üåü **Unlock Multi-Goal Optimization** You have 4 goals. With Premium, I can create advanced meal plans that perfectly balance ALL your goals, provide detailed trade-off analysis, and offer personalized coaching for complex nutrition needs. Ready to maximize your 4-goal nutrition strategy? Upgrade to Premium! üí™"
```

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Data Models
```python
@dataclass
class UserGoal:
    goal_type: str           # 'budget', 'muscle_gain', 'custom'
    priority: int           # 1-4 priority level
    label: Optional[str]    # For custom goals
    constraints: Dict       # Nutrition/lifestyle constraints

@dataclass
class MergedConstraints:
    daily_calories: Optional[int]
    protein_grams: Optional[int]
    max_cost_per_meal: Optional[float]
    emphasized_foods: List[str]
    # ... full constraint set
```

### Constraint Merging Algorithm
1. **Sort by Priority**: Process highest priority goals first
2. **Numeric Constraints**: Take weighted averages or stricter limits
3. **List Constraints**: Union emphasized foods, intersection restrictions
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Higher priority goals override lower priority
5. **Trade-off Tracking**: Document compromises made

### Recipe Scoring System
```python
def score_recipe(recipe, constraints, goals):
    score = 0
    # Cost scoring (budget goals)
    if constraints.max_cost_per_meal:
        score += min(1.0, constraints.max_cost_per_meal / recipe.cost)
    
    # Nutrition scoring (health goals)
    if constraints.protein_grams:
        score += min(1.0, recipe.protein / target_protein)
    
    # Goal compatibility (weighted by priority)
    for goal in goals:
        compatibility = recipe.goal_compatibility[goal.type]
        weight = goal.priority / 4.0
        score += compatibility * weight
    
    return score / factors
```
