> **A progressive personalization platform that transforms how people approach nutrition through WhatsApp/SMS coaching, visual meal logging, and AI-powered insights—designed for profitability from day one.**

## 🎯 Vision

**Nutrition guidance that feels like texting a knowledgeable friend, not using medical software.**

The AI Nutritionist Assistant eliminates the complexity and overwhelm of traditional nutrition apps by meeting users where they are—in their messaging apps. Through progressive personalization over 30 days, we learn user preferences gradually while providing immediate value through budget-conscious meal planning, visual food logging, and seamless calendar integration.

- **Progressive Learning**: Start simple, add complexity naturally as trust builds

Bot: "Perfect! What's your main goal? Save money, lose weight, or just eat better?"
