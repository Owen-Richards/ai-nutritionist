## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.template .env
# Populate Bedrock, Pinpoint, DynamoDB credentials

# Run tests
pytest tests -q

# Local API (requires AWS SAM CLI)
sam build
sam local start-api
```

## Deployment (AWS SAM)

1. Ensure the required AWS services are enabled: Bedrock, Pinpoint, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Lambda, API Gateway.
2. Bootstrap environment variables via Parameter Store (see `docs/deployment_instructions.md`).
3. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```
4. After deployment, update Pinpoint inbound routes to invoke the `UniversalMessageHandlerFunction` API endpoint.

## Testing & Quality

- Unit tests and integration smoke tests via `pytest`.
- Domain validators in `tests/test_project_validation.py` ensure essential assets remain in place.
- Rate limiting, privacy, and observability utilities live under `src/services/infrastructure`.

## Frontend Applications & Packages

The repository now includes a unified JavaScript workspace for client experiences:

- `apps/mobile` â€“ Expo + React Native mobile app (expo-router) sharing UI and schemas
- `apps/web` â€“ Next.js console consuming the same shared packages
- `packages/ui` â€“ React Native compatible component library used across apps
- `packages/api-client` â€“ Fetch wrapper + OpenAPI codegen target for backend endpoints
- `packages/schemas` â€“ Zod contracts for plans, meals, preferences shared across JS clients

### Getting Started (JavaScript workspace)

```bash
# install dependencies (uses Yarn workspaces)
yarn install

# start the mobile app (Expo)
yarn dev:mobile

# run the web app from its workspace
yarn workspace @ai-health/web dev
```

> Note: OpenAPI specs live in `docs/api`. Generate client types with `yarn workspace @ai-health/api-client run generate` once the spec is defined.
### Mobile app best practices snapshot
- Expo Router with typed tab navigation and modal stack
- Central `AppProviders` wiring QueryClient, theme, secure token storage, and monitoring hooks
- Shared UI primitives (`Screen`, `Heading`, `Card`) and design tokens for consistent spacing/colors
- React Query data hooks (`useMealPlans`, `useGroceryList`, `useEntitlements`) with API fallbacks
- ESLint (`eslint-config-expo`) + TypeScript paths/aliases for maintainability
