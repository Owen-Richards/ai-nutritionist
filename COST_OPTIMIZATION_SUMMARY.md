## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### 1. **Integrated Monitoring & Analytics**

Access cost optimization through the built-in services:

```python
# Real-time cost dashboard
from src.services.infrastructure.dashboard import ImprovementDashboard
from src.services.infrastructure.monitoring import PerformanceMonitoringService

dashboard = ImprovementDashboard()
monitoring = PerformanceMonitoringService()

# Get comprehensive system overview
system_health = dashboard.get_real_time_health_check()
performance_metrics = monitoring.get_performance_dashboard()

# Get cost analysis
cost_report = dashboard.generate_improvement_report(days=30)
```

```python
# User-specific cost analysis
from src.services.business.cost_tracking import UserCostTracker
from src.services.business.cost_optimizer import IntelligentCostOptimizer

cost_tracker = UserCostTracker()
optimizer = IntelligentCostOptimizer()

# Analyze specific user
user_costs = cost_tracker.get_user_monthly_summary("+1234567890")
recommendations = optimizer.get_cost_optimization_recommendations()
```

### 2. **API Endpoints for Monitoring**

Access dashboards via HTTP endpoints:

```bash
# Dashboard endpoints (when API is running)
GET /v1/dashboard/system-health
GET /v1/dashboard/cost-analysis
