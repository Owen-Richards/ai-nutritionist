# Privacy-Compliant Multi-User Nutrition Sharing Implementation

## 🔒 GDPR-Compliant Family Nutrition Assistant

Your AI Nutritionist now supports **privacy-compliant multi-user linking** for families, partners, and nutrition accountability partners. This implementation follows GDPR Article 7 requirements and global privacy best practices.

## 🎯 Key Privacy Features Implemented

- **Clear consent language**: Explains exactly what data will be shared
- **Withdrawal rights**: Easy unlinking with "UNLINK" command
- **Audit trails**: Complete consent history for compliance

### ✅ Identity Verification  
- **OTP verification**: 6-digit code sent to invitee's phone
- **Phone ownership proof**: Only person with phone can accept
- **Anti-impersonation**: Rate limiting and secure verification
- **Invite expiration**: 72-hour limit (data minimization)

### ✅ Data Rights (GDPR Articles 15-22)
- **Right to access**: See all shared data with "PRIVACY" command
- **Right to rectify**: Update or correct shared information

### ✅ Data Separation

## 🔐 Technical Privacy Implementation

### Double Opt-In Architecture
```python
# 1. Primary user sends invite
result = linking_service.send_linking_invite(
    primary_user_id="user123",
    invitee_phone="+1234567890", 
    role=LinkingRole.FAMILY_MEMBER,
    permissions=[DataSharingPermission.MEAL_PLANS]
)

# 2. Invitee receives GDPR-compliant consent message
consent_message = build_consent_message(
    primary_name="Alice",
    permissions=permissions,
    verification_otp="123456",
    privacy_policy_url="..."
)

# 3. Invitee must provide OTP + explicit consent
result = linking_service.verify_and_accept_invite(
    invitee_phone="+1234567890",
    verification_otp="123456", 
    consent_confirmation="YES"  # Required explicit consent
)
```

### Data Separation Model
```python
# Each user has separate profile
primary_user = {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "profile": {...},
    "consent_records": [...]
}

linked_user = {
    "user_id": "user456", 
    "profile": {...},
    "consent_records": [...]
}

# Relationship defines controlled sharing
relationship = {
    "primary_user_id": "user123",
    "linked_user_id": "user456",
    "permissions": [
        "meal_plans", 
        "grocery_lists"
    ],
    "consent_audit_trail": {
        "consent_timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "verification_method": "sms_otp",
        "consent_language_version": "1.0"
    }
}
```

### Right to Erasure Implementation
```python
def delete_user_data(user_id, requesting_user_id):
    # 1. Get all relationships
    relationships = get_user_relationships(user_id)
    
    # 2. Notify linked users
    for rel in relationships:
        notify_user_deletion(other_user_id, user_id)
    
    # 3. Remove from all relationships  
    for rel in relationships:
        delete_relationship(rel["id"])
    
    # 4. Delete personal data completely
    user_service.delete_user_completely(user_id)
    
    # 5. Log for compliance audit
    log_deletion_event(user_id, timestamp, method)
```
