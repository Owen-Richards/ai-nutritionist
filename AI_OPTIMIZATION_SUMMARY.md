- **Cost Optimization**: Potential 70% reduction in AI costs

### 4. **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Response times, error rates, costs, cache performance
- **AI-Powered Optimization**: Automatic recommendations for improvements
- **Performance Scoring**: Letter grades (A+ to D) for system health
- **Alert System**: Proactive notifications for issues

### 5. **Circuit Breaker & Resilience**

- **Automatic Failover**: Model failures trigger immediate fallbacks
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery when services restore
- **99.9% Availability**: Designed for enterprise-grade reliability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Meaningful responses even during outages

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Basic Usage (Drop-in Replacement)

```python
from src.services.ai import ai_integration

# Generate meal plan with optimization
meal_plan = await ai_integration.get_meal_plan(
    preferences={'household_size': 4, 'budget': 75},
    user_profile={'tier': 'standard'}
)

# Analyze nutrition with caching
nutrition = await ai_integration.analyze_nutrition('grilled chicken')

# Get recipe suggestions
recipe = await ai_integration.suggest_recipe(
    ingredients=['chicken', 'rice', 'vegetables'],
    preferences={'difficulty_level': 'easy'}
)
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get real-time performance dashboard
dashboard = await ai_integration.get_performance_dashboard()
print(f"Cache Hit Rate: {dashboard['cache_analytics']['performance']['hit_rate']:.2%}")

# Generate performance report
report = await ai_integration.generate_performance_report()
print(f"Performance Grade: {report['performance_grade']}")
```

### 3. Configuration Optimization

```python
# Get optimized configuration for user tier
config = ai_integration.optimize_configuration('premium')
print("Recommended optimizations:", config['recommendations'])
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Results
