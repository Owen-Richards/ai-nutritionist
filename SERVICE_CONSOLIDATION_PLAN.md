# Service Layer Consolidation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State
- **28 services** scattered across single-purpose files
- Import errors in handlers due to missing consolidated services
- Overlapping functionality across multiple services
- Difficult to maintain and understand dependencies

- Clean import paths and resolved dependencies  
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Easy to test and maintain
