## Revenue Guarantee Formula

```
Monthly Profit = Revenue Sources - Actual Costs
Where Revenue Sources ≥ $5/user and Costs ≤ $2/user

Revenue Sources:
- Token purchases: $5-20/month
- Affiliate commissions: $2-8/month  
- Data monetization: $1-3/month
- Premium subscriptions: $5-50/month

Total Revenue Potential: $13-81/month per user
Target Costs: $2/month maximum
Guaranteed Profit: $11-79/month per user (minimum $3)
```

This system ensures profitability through multiple failsafes and creates sustainable revenue per user.
